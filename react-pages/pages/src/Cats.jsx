            Cats with  white fluffy, a pair of clever ears, a pair of shiny ruby like big eyes and a not too small mouth.
                What a lovely Mimi, he brought my childhood countless joy and fun, I like it very much!
                The cat's feet have fat and soft meat pad, walk quietly, do not frighten mice.

                    This lovely kitten body hair is very soft, soft to touch, very comfortable.
                    From a distance, it looks like "a zebra playing in the snow" looms.
                    The cat has a pair of mysterious and intense eyes. Its eyes are golden in the daytime, and turn green at night.
                    Everything is visible. Even in the dark night, the most cunning mouse can not escape its eyes.
